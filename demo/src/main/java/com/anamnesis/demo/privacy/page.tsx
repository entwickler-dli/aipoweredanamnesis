              This tool is intended to be used only by licensed healthcare
              professionals to assist in the first contact with the patience,
              doing an anamnesis and summarising symptoms. This tool do not
              provide any kind of diagnosis and do not suggest or prescribe

          {/* Introduction */}
          <p className="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">
            This software/tool works as a demonstration of the main capabilities. The privacy policy covers the important sections for mitigating risks.
            These are detailed in the seminar paper. It does not cover all aspects of data privacy or represents the final data policy.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Data collection</h2>
          <p>
            The tool diminishes the amount of collected or generated (sensitive) data, which is needed for an anamnesis.
            It covers in particular the user input (in chat), uploaded documents, generated anamnesis and extracted list of symptoms.
            In accordance with the use case of the software no diagnosis is generated.<br />
            <br />
            The user must avoid personal data as text (like name, address, telephone number) in the chat, except properly uploaded documents.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Main processing</h2>
          <p>
            The main processing includes the data collection and display of the data. The data can be accessed by
            the data subject, doctors and professionals within the organization.
          </p>
          <h3>2.1 Background processing</h3>
          <p>
            Next to the main activities outline above, on a regular basis a routine for anonymization, a routine for backups and
            review (search, display) by "processors" like (doctors, professionals) are granted access.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Data destruction</h2>
          <p>
            After three months of inactivity all the (sensitive) data is automatically destroyed and cannot be restored.
            This processing autonomously works with any human interaction.
          </p>

          <h3>3.1 On request</h3>
          <p>
            The data subject can request the deletion in written. This covers all his data and is confirmed.
            The implementation takes place soon thereafter.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Backup</h2>
          <p>
            On a regular basis the client data is backed up. The client data resides in there for the same
            time named in section "Data destruction" (three months).
          </p>

          <h2>5. Revocation of consent</h2>
          <p>
            The client can every time revoke his consent for processing in written. The revocation applies to all his sensitive data.
            Albeit his personal data and processing relating to her/his technical account remains active. The deletion of all data needs to be explicitly requested.
          </p>
